# api-gateway-rest-classes-master

Amazon API Gateway is a service for creating, publishing, monitoring and protecting REST APIs that are provisioned on your server, be it an EKS, AWS Lambda or service from another Cloud Provider on the Internet. In this course you will create APIs that access integrated services from AWS itself, services exposed on the Internet, create Proxy-type APIs, Mocks and much more.

We will address 6 (six) sessions going through:



Session 1 - What is API Gateway?

Here you will get a basis of what an API Gateway is, such as functional and non-functional requirements of an API Gateway and the difference between Rest, HTTP and Websocket. We will also understand API Gateway limits within AWS and differences between Private, Regional, and Edge-Optimized API.

Session 2 - Creating an API Gateway Rest

This will be the biggest and most important session of our course, here we will create our API and start adding features little by little, we will also understand how the request path works, integration with native AWS services such as SQS, VPC Link (Network Load Balancer Private), AWS Lambda and Mock for testing. We will add caching to our API to ensure better performance and availability, we will also create request validation, being Header, Query String and Body. Still in this section, we will see Models and Templates to return a response to standardized requests.

Session 3 - Security in API Gateway

In this session we will create two authorization methods, Lambda Authorizer and AWS IAM. Here we will also work with services such as SSM Parameter Store and Python for integration with AWS services. Finally, we will talk about the Resource Policy, a feature that ensures that only authorized components can access our API, even if it is exposed to the internet.

Session 4 - Configuring Throttling

We'll cover Rate & Burst Limit, explaining the difference between the two features and how to use the two together. We are also going to talk about Usage Plan and API Key to separate request quotas by criticality plan and having a greater granularity in the request limit settings for our clients.

Session 5 - Configuring Logs & Metrics
We will deal with Logs/Metrics to understand what is happening in our API, we will create a custom log to speed up possible troubleshooting, view consolidated dashboards in AWS and we will also create our own dashboard with several visualization options.

Session 6 - Creating our Custom Domain
We will cover architecture between Route 53, ACM and Amazon API Gateway Custom Domain Name. We will also create our own domain to use a custom domain. we will provide a free certificate by AWS Certificate Manager to associate with our domain and in the end we will consolidate these settings in front of our API.
